//(1) - In the BankVault.swift file, create a protocol named ProvideAccess. This protocol should require any class/struct that conforms to it to implement a function called allowEntryWithPassword which takes in one argument called password of type [Int] (an array of Ints). The function should return a Bool.
//(2) - In the BankVault.swift file, below where you created the ProvideAccess protocol - create an extension on the BankVault class. In that extension, it should conform to the ProvideAccess protocol. In your implementation of the allowEntryWithPassword(_:) function, you should adhere to the following rules:
//If the person calling on this function doesn't enter in any digits (empty array), then we should return false.
//If the total numbers of digits entered (items in the array) exceed 10, then we should return false.
//In order to allow access (return true), every other digit (starting with the first digit) must be even. The first digit entered is the first element in the array.
//There are tests in the BankVaultTests.swift file. Press command + u to run these tests to make sure you implemented the allowEntryWithPassword(_:) function correctly.

    let name: String

        }
        for (index, digit) in password.enumerated() {
            guard index%2 == 0 else { continue }
            if digit%2 != 0 {
